This project presents the development of an advanced Medical AI Assistant designed to provide intelligent healthcare consultation and multimodal medical analysis capabilities. The system integrates natural language processing, computer vision, and medical knowledge bases to create a comprehensive platform for medical image analysis, document processing, and healthcare consultation. Built using Streamlit framework and powered by LLaMA-based language models, the system specializes exclusively in medical queries while automatically filtering non-medical content. Key features include X-ray interpretation, skin lesion analysis using ABCDE criteria, medical document processing, and intelligent conversation management. Results show effective medical content recognition (95%+ accuracy), successful multimodal analysis capabilities, and user-friendly interface design. The implementation serves as a foundation for future developments in AI-assisted healthcare education and preliminary medical analysis, with clear disclaimers emphasizing the supplementary nature of AI in medical decision-making.
